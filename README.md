# Python Games Collection

Welcome to my Python Games Collection repository! This repository contains a collection of games I've developed as part of my learning journey with Python. Each game is a small project 
designed to help me grasp various programming concepts and improve my coding skills.

## Games Included

1. **Game 1: Simple Number Guessing Game**
   - The user is prompted to enter two values, one being the lower bound of the random number, the other the upper bound.  A random number is generated and the user tries to guess it, the
     game gives hints if the player is too low or high.  It will also display the total number of guesses to the user as they play.  When the player guesses the number correctly they win!
     Total guesses are displayed and they are asked if they want to play again, very simple.
   
   - Simply download the python file for the game and a Python runtime environment.  They can either open the game via a terminal window, i.e. python Guessing Game.py or in the python
     runtime environment.
